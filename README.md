# ALNS-PTA heuristic for the DRP-HCL

Rust implementation of the adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic with pulsed threshold acceptance (ALNS-PTA) for the drayage routing problem with heterogeneous fleet, compatibility constraints, and truck load configurations (DRP-HCL). This heuristic was introduced by Bustos Coral (2023) to tackle the DRP-HCL involving longer combination vehicles (LCVs).
